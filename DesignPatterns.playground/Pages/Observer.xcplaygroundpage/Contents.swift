 To make a class *observable* it needs to extend the class `Observable`.\
 Now you get to make the repository observable!
 
 * Experiment:
 Change the code below to make `Repository` observable.
 
 - Example:
 Quick reminder: In Swift you extend a class like this:\
 `class YourClass : ClassToExtend {`\
          `    ... (einr√ºcken)`\
 `}`
