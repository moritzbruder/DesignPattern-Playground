//: # Design Patterns
/*:
 This playground is supposed to help you understand the basics of a few commonly used object-oriented software design patterns.
 
 We will explore all of the patterns with the help of a very simple iOS-Application, that is running in XCode's **Live View** for this playground.
 
 Therefore it's best if you work your way through the patterns in order
